  <h2>Professional Brag Book</h2>
  <h3>Welcome</h3>
  <p>Welcome and thank you for coming to my Professional Brag Book.  This was an interesting concept to me.  I hear from people in different organizations speak on the importance of documenting your work and having all your successes documented.  This project provides just that for me.  </p>
  <p>Here you will find information about my experience in the Principles of Management course at Washtenaw Community College.</p>

For my Brag book I will perform an interview with my manager, attend a networking event and publish it online.

<p>As I reflect on the semester, the project planning portion of the class helped me learn about management.  In my team, we are usually given a project to work on.  It is rare that we initiate projects for ourselves.  Brainstorming with my team member provided the opportunity to share ideas and come to a consensus on what we could do.  The best part is that it was a real problem for a team member.  Her office had difficulty communicating with a satellite location.  We were able to look at a real-world problem and think about how we would solve it together.</p>
<p>This experience helped me experience the project life cycle.  We identified a problem, prepared a solution and then thought through the steps to execute.  While we did not actually implement the solution, I believe we were well prepared to carry out the project and achieve the goal of a communication platform.  I learned that it is very difficult to plan for everything, but if we think of the key milestones and objectives, the risk is lowered and our opportunity for success grows substantially.  </p>
<p>I plan to use the skills we learned and practiced during our group assignment in my current role.  Throughout the course I have looked for ways to utilize the information given.  I work on large scale projects and understanding management styles and the benefit of each will enable me to be flexible in how I interact with my team members.  Leadership never ends.  This class and experience with working with others will help me grow in my leadership goals. </p>

        <div class="panel-body">
<p>I believe that leadership involves a great deal of humility, compassion and vision.  As a manager, I feel that it is critical to encourage a team dynamic.  There can be healthy competition to encourage innovation and productivity if the team is challenged.  As a leader I feel that it is important to allow your team to feel empowered to make decisions, while the leader is looking forward for the next goals.  </p>
<p>In my current role, while I do not have direct reports, I do lead project teams.  I try to encourage my colleagues and find ways to bring out their best.  I look for ways to show that areas of improvement are opportunities.  I look for ways to celebrate successes.  My philosophy is we work as a team, win as a team, fail as a team.  As a leader, the tone and direction of the team, I have a great impact on how we move from a storming group of individuals to a performing team.</p>

<p>I attended a workshop hosted by Sisters Code in Detroit, MI.  Sisters Code is an organization created by Marlin Williams, who is the Chief Program Officer at TechTown Detroit & Assistant Vice President for Economic Development at Wayne State University.  The organization is a meetup group that allows Black women to network while learning how to code with or without a technical background.</p>
<p>I attended a workshop in which we created a tip calculator website.   The instructor is a software engineer with StockX.  She provided us with a starter set of files.  During the session, we walked through the steps to take the files and make the site functional.  We used JavaScript code to execute the calculations.</p>
<p>We also learned how to publish our website using a free hosting site.  We also learned where to go to buy our own domains especially if we wanted to showcase our work in a portfolio setting.</p>
<p>This group is great for me.  While I am not an engineer, I work on a team of engineers.  By attending workshops like these, I can learn the language needed to communicate requirements to the developers.  It also gives me an opportunity to network with other Black women who share an interest in continuing education and technology.  </p>
